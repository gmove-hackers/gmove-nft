The Move NFT Studio provides a one stop shop for dynamic and composable NFT's. Creators can create collections, add combinations, evolutions and more. Users can then not only mint the NFT on the frontend, but also use the Move NFT Studio to interact with the NFT in whatever way the creator has configured it. The possibilities are endless!

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Move, React, Vite, shadcn/ui and tailwind.

- üó≥Ô∏è **Easily create NFT collections**: With our intuitive creation page, creators can easily create new collections.
- üíó **Dynamic NFT's**: Move NFT Studio allows creators to create dynamic collections, in any way they can imagine. Combine two NFT's, or allow NFT's to evolve after certain criteria have been met. The sky is the limit!
- üèóÔ∏è **Composable NFT's**: Creators can define rules for equipment related to their collection. NFT holders can use Move NFT Studio to discover all the ways they can use or equip their NFT's.

## Next steps
This hackathon project is a proof of concept for the Move NFT Studio. We plan to keep building and add more features, so Move NFT Studio will become the platform where creators and holders can do everything they want with their NFT's. Features that we want to add:
- In NFT details page, display all NFT's held by this NFT
- Equiping logic for NFT owned by NFT
- Evolution logic
- NFT marketplace
